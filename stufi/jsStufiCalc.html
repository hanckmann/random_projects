  This is an HTML form that allows the user to enter data, and allows
  JavaScript to display the results it computes back to the user. The
  form elements are embedded in a table to improve their appearance.
  Note that some of the form elements define "onChange" or "onClick"
  event handlers. These specify strings of JavaScript code to be
  executed when the user enters data or clicks on a button.
